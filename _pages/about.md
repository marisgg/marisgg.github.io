I am affiliated with the <a href='https://sws.cs.ru.nl/'>Department of Software Science (SWS)</a> of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/icis/'>Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)</a>, located at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 

I am supervised by <a href='https://www.nilsjansen.org'>Prof. Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, part of the <a href='https://ai-fm.org/'>AI-FM</a> research group and member of the coordinator team of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/ai/ellis-unit'>ELLIS Unit Nijmegen</a>. My ELLIS PhD exchange host is <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/'>Prof. Dr. Nick Hawes</a> from the <a href='https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/goals/'>GOALS</a> research group of the <a href='https://ori.ox.ac.uk/'>Oxford Robotics Institute</a> located at Oxford University in the United Kingdom.

My research interests revolve around **sequential decision-making under uncertainty**. More specifically, I specialize in model-based reinforcement learning and (online) planning in **partially observable and uncertain environments**. 

My work focuses on developing **scalable** and **robust algorithms** to enable real-world applications. Therefore, the aim is to combine the robustness of model-based approaches with the scalability of data-driven learning techniques.
