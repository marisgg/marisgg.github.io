I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href='https://sws.cs.ru.nl/'>Department of Software Science (SWS)</a> of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/icis/'>Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)</a>, located at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I am supervised by <a href='https://www.nilsjansen.org'>Prof. Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, part of the <a href='https://lava-lab.org/'>LAVA-LAB</a> research group, and member of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/ai/ellis-unit'>ELLIS Unit Nijmegen</a>.

My research interests in general revolve around sequential decision making under uncertainty. More specifically, I specialize in model-based reinforcement learning and online planning in partially observable and uncertain environments. My work focuses on developing algorithms that are both scalabe and robust to enable real-world applications. Therefore, the aim is to combine the robustness of model-based approaches with the scalability of data-driven learning techniques.
