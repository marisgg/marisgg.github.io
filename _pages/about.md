I am an <a href='https://ellis.eu/projects/model-based-reinforcement-learning-and-planning-under-uncertainty'>ELLIS PhD Candidate</a> at the <a href='https://sws.cs.ru.nl/'>Department of Software Science (SWS)</a> of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/icis/'>Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)</a>, located at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I am supervised by <a href='https://www.nilsjansen.org'>Prof. Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, part of the <a href='https://ai-fm.org/'>AI-FM</a> research group, and part of the coordinator team of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/ai/ellis-unit'>ELLIS Unit Nijmegen</a>. My ELLIS PhD exchange host is <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/'>Prof. Dr. Nick Hawes</a> from the Oxford Robotics Institute at Oxford University.

My research interests revolve around sequential decision-making under uncertainty. More specifically, I specialize in model-based reinforcement learning and (online) planning in partially observable and uncertain environments. 

My work focuses on developing scalable and robust algorithms to enable real-world applications. Therefore, the aim is to combine the robustness of model-based approaches with the scalability of data-driven learning techniques.
