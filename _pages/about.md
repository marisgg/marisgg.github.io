I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href='https://sws.cs.ru.nl/'>Department of Software Science (SWS)</a> of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/icis/'>Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)</a>, located at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I am supervised by <a href='https://www.nilsjansen.org'>Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, part of the <a href='https://lava-lab.org/'>LAVA-LAB</a> research group, and member of the <a href='https://www.ru.nl/ai/ellis-unit'>ELLIS Unit Nijmegen</a>.

My research interests revolve around model-based (reinforcement) learning and (online) planning. Specifically, I strive to improve the robustness and safety of such algorithms, and aim to scale these methods to realistic problem-sizes.
